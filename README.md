# Call Centre Trends Dashboard

## Introduction

Our mission is to create a powerful and insightful dashboard using Power BI that provides an in-depth overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics related to call center trends. We aim to deliver a comprehensive tool that empowers organizations to make data-driven decisions for enhancing their call center operations and customer support.

In this endeavor, we focus on several essential KPIs that shed light on different aspects of call center performance:

- **Overall Customer Satisfaction:** This critical KPI allows us to gauge and understand the satisfaction levels of customers who have reached out to the call center for support. Their feedback is invaluable in assessing the quality of service provided and identifying areas for improvement.

- **Overall Calls Answered/Abandoned:** This KPI serves as a key indicator of call center efficiency. It quantifies the number of calls that were successfully answered by dedicated agents versus the number of calls that customers abandoned while waiting. Analyzing this metric provides insights into call center responsiveness and customer retention.

- **Calls by Time:** We delve into the temporal aspect of call center operations by analyzing the volume of incoming calls during different times of the day, week, or month. Understanding these call patterns is crucial for optimizing staff allocation and ensuring prompt customer support.

- **Average Speed of Answer:** This KPI provides a quantitative measure of the efficiency of call center operations. It indicates the average time taken by agents to answer incoming customer calls. A low average speed of answer is often associated with high customer satisfaction, making it a vital metric for performance assessment.

- **Agent's Performance Quadrant - Average Handle Time (Talk Duration) vs. Calls Answered:** We assess agent performance based on two critical parameters: the average handle time of calls and the number of calls answered. By plotting agents within this quadrant, we gain insights into their efficiency in managing customer interactions. This analysis helps in recognizing high-performing agents and areas where additional training or support may be needed.

## Vision

Our vision is to empower organizations with a comprehensive and visually appealing dashboard that brings these KPIs to life. By visualizing call center trends, we aim to facilitate data-driven decision-making and drive improvements in customer support and overall operational efficiency.
